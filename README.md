# Boston-housing-price-prediction

In this project I have used multi-regression model to establish a significant linear-relationship of factors affecting the housing prices,based on which I tested 
the model for the assumptions of classical Linear Regression Model like Multicollinearity, Heteroscadasticity, and Autocorrelation to obtain a best fit model
